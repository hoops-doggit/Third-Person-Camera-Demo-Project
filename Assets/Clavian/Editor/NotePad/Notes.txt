Need:
code that moves camera out of objects when penetration occurs


Pitch gravity 


Later
Remove IVirtualCamera.Active if I don't use it.
Make orbit camera go to posiiton of desired start pos
Make it possible to iterate on values at editor time - m

Ideas
Orbit camera that has a custom tracking point or! we use a hint to orbit another object.
